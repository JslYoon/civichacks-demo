MASSACHUSETTS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM — PROGRESS REPORT 2025

INCARCERATION OVERVIEW
Massachusetts state prison population: 6,847 (down 18% from 2019). County jail population: 4,291 (down 12% from 2019). Incarceration rate: 152 per 100,000 residents (lowest in the nation, national avg: 350). Despite low overall rate, racial disparities persist: Black residents are incarcerated at 7.9x the rate of White residents. Hispanic/Latino residents at 4.2x the rate. These disparities have not improved since the 2018 Criminal Justice Reform Act.

PRETRIAL DETENTION
Average daily pretrial population: 3,412 (48% of total jail population). Average length of pretrial detention: 94 days. 62% of pretrial detainees held on bail amounts of $5,000 or less. Racial breakdown of pretrial detainees: Black 38%, Hispanic/Latino 31%, White 27%, Other 4%. The 2018 reform act's bail provisions reduced cash bail usage by 23%, but judges increasingly use dangerousness hearings (up 45% since 2019) as an alternative path to detention.

Suffolk County (Boston) data shows: 71% of individuals held pretrial on low-level charges are eventually released without further incarceration. The average cost of pretrial detention is $182 per person per day. Individuals detained pretrial are 2.5x more likely to plead guilty compared to those released, even when charged with similar offenses.

RECIDIVISM
Three-year recidivism rate (re-incarceration): 32%. Rate by offense type: property crimes 41%, drug offenses 38%, violent offenses 24%. Individuals who participated in prison education programs had a 28% lower recidivism rate. Those who secured employment within 30 days of release had a 47% lower recidivism rate. However, 68% of formerly incarcerated individuals reported difficulty finding employment, and 41% experienced housing instability within 6 months of release.

Access to reentry services varies dramatically by county. Suffolk County (Boston) offers 14 reentry programs; Berkshire County offers 2. The state's FY2025 reentry budget of $28 million serves approximately 8,400 individuals — an estimated 35% of those released annually.

POLICING DATA

Black residents are 23% of Boston's population but subject to 63% of FIO stops. 89% of FIO stops resulted in no arrest, citation, or further action. The most common reason cited: "suspicious behavior" (47%).

Use of force incidents: 387 reported (down 8% from 2024). 72% involved Black or Hispanic/Latino individuals. The BPD body camera program achieved 94% compliance (officers activating cameras during encounters). Internal affairs complaints: 412 filed, 31 sustained (7.5% sustain rate). Average time to resolve a complaint: 278 days.

Youth who received community-based alternatives had a 19% lower re-offense rate than those committed to facilities. However, 73% of youth committed to DYS had a documented mental health diagnosis, and only 48% received treatment services.

School-to-prison pipeline indicators: Students suspended or expelled from BPS are 3.1x more likely to have juvenile justice contact within 2 years. Black students are suspended at 4x the rate of White students in BPS.

IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT INTERSECTION
Massachusetts is not an ICE cooperation state (Trust Act, 2017). However, 847 immigration detainers were lodged with state and county facilities in 2025. Suffolk County Sheriff's office received 312 detainer requests and honored 0. Bristol County received 198 and honored 41 (before a policy change in June 2025). An estimated 12,000 undocumented residents in Massachusetts have criminal records that could trigger deportation proceedings. Legal aid organizations report 18-month wait times for immigration court hearings in Boston, with only 37% of respondents having legal representation.

ACCESS TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION
Public defender caseloads in Suffolk County average 418 cases per attorney per year (national standard recommends no more than 150 for misdemeanors).
